"""  The complete Alicevision photogrammetry pipeline. """

This node is a one node pipeline with Alicevision photogrammetry. Contained in this node are all the steps required to use Alicevision for your convenience.

NOTE:
    Requires Meshroom/AliceVision version 2023.3.0. See [https://alicevision.org/#meshroom|https://alicevision.org/#meshroom] for information on how to download.

@parameters
    == Main ==
    Cook:
        Start the cooking process for this step.
    Use Log:
        This toggle controls if the status of the current node should be printed to the console. This is useful for getting a quick overview of the progress.
    == Initialize ==
    Project Name:
        This is the project name that Alicevision will use for creating project files. It is important to have a unique project name per processed object to prevent accidental overwrites.
    Cache Directory:
        This directory will be used to store all the generated data. Removing this directory will undo any progress so far.
    Alicevision Directory:
        This can be used to point to the compiled binaries of Alicevision that should be used for processing.
    Default Field of View:
        Empirical value for the field of view in degree.
    Color Mode:
        This controls if the final mesh should use vertex color or textures.
    Environment:
	The environment used for launching the AliceVision utilities command line. Note that this is a python expression and should be modified only through "Edit Expression".
    Images:
        This multiparm holds all images as entries that need to be processed by Alicevision.
    

@outputs
Textured Geometry:
    This is the final geometry produced by Alicevision.
Pointcloud:
    This is the point cloud generated by the meshing step.
Cameras:
    These are the camera transforms that have been extracted from the images processed.
