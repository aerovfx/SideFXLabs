"""Enables the use of RizomUV and performs a UV unwrap inside Houdini"""

[Image:/images/sidefxlabs_banner.jpg]

The RizomUV Unwrap allows you to perform a UV unwrap inside Houdini by running RizomUV on the background. There are different uvwrap methods to choose from, as well as different smoothing and optimization options.

    Method:
        #id: method
        The method contains advanced algorithms that automatically selects edges of the visible island sets to cut.
        
        Pelt:
        Selects edges using the Single-Cut algorithm. Extremities of the visible islands will be linked and the hierarchy sections will also be selected if Select Leafs, Select Branches, or Select Trunks are enabled.
            
        Mosaic:
        Selects edges using the Mosaic algorithm. Planar surfaces of the model will be extracted so that the mesh will be segmented into smaller parts.
            
        Sharp Edges:
        Selects edges using the Sharp Edges algorithm. Each edge that has their two connected polygon normals and make an angle superior to a threshold will be selected.
            
        Box:
        Selects edges using the Box algorithm. Each island is projected on 6 orthogonal planes and form several polygon groups. All polygon groups borders are then selected.
            
    Select Leafs:
        #id: enableleaf
        Single-cut segmentation will select the trunk's sections.
        
    Select Branches:
        #id: enablebranch
        Single-cut segmentation will select the branch's sections.
        
    Select Trunks:
        #id: enabletrunk
        Single-cut segmentation will select the leaf's sections.
        
    Force:
        #id: force
        High values will segment more so the islands will be unfolded with less distortion. Low values will segment less but the cut will generate more distortion.
                
    Enable Island Count:
        #id: enableislandcount
        Mosaic segmentation will not automatically determine the island count for each island to segment, but rather use the specific value.
        
    Island Count:
        #id: islandcount
        The number of parts in which each island will be segmented into.
        
    Angle Limit:
        #id: anglelimit
        Edges that have their polygon normals forming an angle larger than this value will be selected.
        
    X+Y+:
        #id: xposypos
        Auto Select Box will select the edge intersecting virtual box faces X+ and Y+.
        
    X+Z+:
        #id: xposzpos
        Auto Select Box will select the edge intersecting virtual box faces X+ and Z+.
        
    X+Y-:
        #id: xposyneg
        Auto Select Box will select the edge intersecting virtual box faces X+ and Y-.
        
    X+Z-:
        #id: xposzneg
        Auto Select Box will select the edge intersecting virtual box faces X+ and Z-.
        
    Y+Z+:
        #id: yposzpos
        Auto Select Box will select the edge intersecting virtual box faces Y+ and Z+.
        
    Y-Z+:
        #id: ynegzpos
        Auto Select Box will select the edge intersecting virtual box faces Y- and Z+.
        
    Y-Z-:
        #id: ynegzneg
        Auto Select Box will select the edge intersecting virtual box faces Y- and Z-.
        
    Y+Z-:
        #id: yposzneg
        Auto Select Box will select the edge intersecting virtual box faces Y+ and Z-.
        
    X-Y+:
        #id: xnegypos
        Auto Select Box will select the edge intersecting virtual box faces X- and Y+.
        
    X-Z+:
        #id: xnegzpos
        Auto Select Box will select the edge intersecting virtual box faces X- and Z+.
        
    X-Y-:
        #id: xnegyneg
        Auto Select Box will select the edge intersecting virtual box faces X- and Y-.
        
    X-Z-:
        #id: xnegzneg
        Auto Select Box will select the edge intersecting virtual box faces X- and Z-.

    Prevent Overlaps:
        #id: enablestretchcontrol
        Checks the stretching and adds enough cuts to ensure there are no flips or overlaps once the mesh will be unfolded.
        
    Limit Stretches:
        #id: stretchcontrol
        High values will give less stretching and angle distortion but will select more edges.
        
    == Advanced Options ==

    Cut Handles:
        #id: cuthandles
        Selects the handles in the post-process.
        
    Link Gaps:
        #id: linkgaps
        Selects links between gaps in the post-process.
        
    Enable Denoise:
        #id: denoise
        Small details will tend to be ignored.
        
    Mix:
        #id: mix
        A value close to 1 will ignore the small details of the mesh. Too much denoise can make some local stretching appear, even if the stretch limiter is enabled.
        
    Enable Reweld:
        #id: enablereweld
        Welds edges without creating overlaps. When this option is enabled the stretch limit and angle limit may not be respected and might create additional distortion.
        
    Threshold:
        #id: reweldthreshold
        The maximum relative distance between two edges that allows them to be welded. The distance is relative to the average edge length.
        
    Max Poly:
        #id: reweldmaxpoly
        Authorizes welding of islands if their polycount is below this value.
        
    Max Length:
        #id: reweldmaxlength
        Authorizes welding of islands if their UV space maximum bounding box dimension is below this value.
        
    Enable Limit Length:
        #id: enablesizelimiter
        Cuts a UV island in two when its' maximum bounding box length over the average of the maximum bounding box length of all islands exceeds the Length Ratio.
        
    Length Ratio:
        #id: lengthratio
        The maximum allowed ratio of the bounding box length over the average of the maximum bounding box length of all islands. Low values create more cuts, while high values create less cuts.
