"""Enables the use of RizomUV and performs a UV optimize inside Houdini"""

The RizomUV Optimize allows you to perform a UV optimize inside Houdini by running RizomUV on the background.


@parameters

    Cook:
        #id: cook
        Starts the cooking process for this step.
        
    Auto Cook:
        #id: autocook
        This toggle controls if the node should automatically recook if any dependencies have changed.
        
    == UV ==

    UV Attribute:
        #id: outgoinguv
        The UV sets that are send to RizomUV to perform the actions.

    Delete Original UVs:
        #id: clearuv
        Removes the present UVs before processing in RizomUV.

    UDIM Tile Offset (x/y):
        #id: uvtilesoffset
        Specifies the offset of the resulting tile in which the UVs are placed.
        
    == Optimize ==

    Iterations:
        #id: iterations
        The number of iterations for the optimize algorithm.
        
    Power:
        #id: optimizationforce
        The optimization strength that compliments the number of iterations.

    Angles/Lengths:
        #id: angledistancemix
        The mix between conservation of angles and distances. A value of 0 will result in angle conservation, while a value of 1 will result in a distances conservation.
                
    Prevent Flips:
        #id: preventflips
        Avoids the creation of triangle flips. This can significantly increase the unwrapping or optimizing calculation time.
        
    Prevent Overlaps:
        #id: preventoverlaps
        Avoids the creation of self border intersections. This can increase the unwrapping or optimizing calculation time.
    
    Fill Gaps:
        #id: fillgaps
        Fills the gaps in the mesh by adding invisible and temporary polygons to the model. When an unwrap or optimize is performed, it prevents the hole from collapsing on various types of unwraps. Recommended to use on eyes, mouths, nostrils, clothing, or hard edge openings like the gap on top of a tank or non-square windows.
            
    == Settings ==

    RizomUV Path:
        #id: rizomuvpath
        The path to the RizomUV executable.

    Temp Mesh Path:
        #id: tempmeshpath
        The path to the temporary mesh file.
