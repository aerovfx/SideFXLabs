"""Loads a single `.zibravdb` file from disk and decompresses it to a VDB sequence."""


As a part of the [ZibraVDB for Houdini|https://effects.zibra.ai/zibravdbhoudini] plugin, this node loads a single, highly compressed `.zibravdb` file from disk and decompresses it to a VDB sequence. It supports both animated VDB sequences and static VDB geometries.

:platform:Windows
    ZibraVDB for Houdini is currently only supported on Windows.
