"""Loads a single `.zibravdb` file from disk and decompresses it as a VDB sequence."""


As a part of the [ZibraVDB for Houdini (Alpha)|https://effects.zibra.ai/zibravdbhoudini] plugin, this node loads a single, highly compressed `.zibravdb` file from disk. The file may contain either a single frame or a frame sequence of VDB geometry. In both cases, the entire sequence is loaded at once, with frames decompressed on demand using a frame index parameter.

This significantly speeds up playback for high-resolution VDBs by eliminating the need to load one frame from disk at a time. Additionally, the total size of the data to be loaded is much smaller. The decompression occurs on the GPU and is extremely fast.

:platform:Windows
    ZibraVDB for Houdini (Alpha) is currently only supported on Windows.

@parameters

    Input File:
        #id: filename
        The file path from which to load the compressed VDB geometry. The file extension must be `.zibravdb`.

    Sequence Frame:
        #id: frame
        The index of the frame to decompress and display. This differs from the original frame number, as the index starts at `0` and represents the frame's position in the sequence. For example, if your VDB sequence was originally cached from frame `1001` to `1240`, set this to `0` to decompress and display frame `1001`.

    Reload Cache:
        #id: refresh
        Forces a reload of the `.zibravdb` file from disk and refreshes the decompressed frame.
