"""Compresses a VDB sequence and caches it to disk as a single  `.zibravdb` file."""


As a part of the [ZibraVDB for Houdini (Alpha)|https://effects.zibra.ai/zibravdbhoudini] plugin, this node caches a VDB sequence to disk as a single, highly compressed `.zibravdb` file. It can compress both animated VDB sequences and static VDB geometries.

The compression often achieves up to 97â€“99% reduction in VDB file size with minimal quality loss. The compression rate is adjustable for each VDB field, providing independent control over the quality and memory footprint of `density`, `temperature`, `flame`, and other standard or custom fields. Up to 8 float fields can be compressed simultaneously.

TIP:
    You may also compress SDF VDBs indirectly. Convert SDF VDBs to Fog VDBs before compression and back to SDF VDBs after decompression using the [Convert VDB SOP|Node:/sop/convertvdb].

NOTE:
    Vector VDBs currently cannot be compressed. This feature will be supported in the future. In the meantime, you can split vector VDBs to float VDBs using the [VDB Vector Split SOP|Node:/sop/vdbvectorsplit] before compression. After decompression, merge the float VDBs back to vector VDBs using the [VDB Vector from Scalar SOP|Node:/sop/vdbvectormerge]. Please note that compressing vectors is not exactly the same as compressing vector components independently, so this current workaround may yield unexpected results.

:platform:Windows
    ZibraVDB for Houdini (Alpha) is currently only supported on Windows.
